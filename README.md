I made this app just for fun.
I will add a lot of features.

I am building this project because one of my friend denied to let me contribute in his repository.
So I made a project of my own.

# App setup

1. Stay in root directory
2. Run `install:all`: To install all dependencies in both frontend and backend
3. Run `start:all`: To start the server for production
4. Run `start:frontend`: To start the react app on devlopment mode
5. Run `start:backend`: To start the backend in devlopment mode
